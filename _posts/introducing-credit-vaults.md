Crypto must go faster. We have started Ithaca, a company designed to accelerate the crypto frontier, and have raised $20M from Paradigm.

Over the past four years, our global group of less than 20 engineers has shipped some of the industry’s most used open source tools like Reth & Foundry. We believe in sustainable open source development for the good of crypto, and in creating the right incentive system for commercial consumer experiences.

The stack is ready. We can achieve the step-level changes needed to enable consumers to fully leverage crypto with fast, cheap, global and private experiences.

Our first step in that mission is Odyssey, an open-source Layer 2 testnet from the future, built with Reth, the OP Stack and Conduit. You can try it out today on Sepolia and start building with its unique features. We have been collaborating with the developer community and industry for the last years, and we are excited to continue accelerating crypto together.

As you set out for Ithaca hope your road is a long one, full of adventure, full of discovery.

Laistrygonians, Cyclops, angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them: you’ll never find things like that on your way as long as you keep your thoughts raised high, as long as a rare excitement stirs your spirit and your body. — [Cavafy, 1-9](https://app.union.finance/)
